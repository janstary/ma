syntax:
	whitespace separates left and right; _ is the blank
	do we want to restrict the characters used?

parser:
	the first two strings on a line constitute the rule;
	the rest of the loine can be used for comments

preprocesor: generate e.g. rules for all chars of the alphabet.
For example, the following set of rules

	*aa	a*a
	*ab	b*a
	*ba	a*b
	*bb	b*b

in copy.am could be more succintly given as

	*XY	Y*X

for any X,Y in {a,b}
